    "# My history with Python\n",
    "* I come from the land of C and FORTRAN\n",
    "* I am trained as a physicist and biophysicist, with almost no formal CS background.\n",
    "* I first used started using Python for image processing, about 15 years ago.\n",
    "* I've been writing Python daily for the last couple of years.\n",
    "* I now work as a Data Scientist, essentially interpreting human telemetry data in shopping contexts.\n",
    "* I have seen and used an actual working VT100 terminal, in my home.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Jupyter, the debugger, and profiling\n",
    "* This is the first time I've used Jupyter. People say it's good for presentations?\n",
    "* Remember: I come from the land of FORTRAN and C, before even IDEs were common.\n",
    "* I have come to love and rely on the debugger fairly recently. \n",
    "* Profiling code is vastly under-utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "# An approximate outline\n",
    "* What is the role of a debugger? (<i> and the trap of scripting languages!!!</i>)\n",
    "* Avoiding the debugger: Tips on how to write manageable code from someone who writes a lot of unmanageable code.\n",
    "* BROKEN CODE!\n",
    "* What is the role of profiling, and when should I use it?\n",
    "* What to do when your code isss sooooo sloooowwwwwww.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why use a debugger?\n",
    "## The temptation of scripting languages\n",
    "* We've all used `print(\"My integer is %d\" % myinteger)` in some form or other.\n",
    "* If you are like me, you have had that statement raise a `TypeError` because `myinteger = str(3)` was the actual underlying bug. \n",
    "* This is the most basic debugging\n",
    "* if you've ever read Apache GreatestThingEver logs, you'll recognize it's more sophisticated cousin `logging`.\n",
    "* I think it is a terrible habit, one that we got from the ease with which scripts can be run.\n",
    "* With tools like hadoop, it is sometimes the only way (AWS EMR was built for production, not development). \n",
    "* But it is slow, error prone, and doesn't allow realtime feedback.<p>\n",
    "### Lesson\n",
    "<b><i>We want to be able to make and test hypotheses of what's wrong in our code quickly!</i></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding what our code is doing.\n",
    "* Often we make assumptions about what our code is doing that prove false.\n",
    "* Very often, we want to test what our code will do if we give it odd or bad input.\n",
    "### Lesson\n",
    "<b><i>The debugger is also a tool to quickly test for fragile code and edge cases:</i></b> we can run our setup, and then alter the input <i>in situ</i> to test how short fragments will behave. \n",
    "\n",
    "# But first: Avoid debugging in the first place.\n",
    "* Use a good IDE!\n",
    "  * I use PyCharm. Atom is okay. There's one that starts with S that seems to be good if you're a developer.\n",
    "  * Find one that does type checking, static error checking, PEP8.\n",
    "* Other modules\n",
    "  * PyLint and related tools are mostly style checkers, but they can be helpful.\n",
    "  * pyflakes does some error and type checking, looks for undeclared names... \n",
    "  * but really, get a good IDE.\n",
    "* TESTS!\n",
    "  * Tests are irritating from a Data Science perspective, because most of them are poorly designed.\n",
    "  * A good test does not have explicit input. A good test generates the input according to a model.\n",
    "  * A good test doesn't compare to explicit floating point numbers, unless it is testing the values of constants or distributions.\n",
    "  * A good test doesn't test that a model prediction doesn't change, it tests the logic of the model.\n",
    "  * <b><i> The best tests communicate the assumptions, required input, and function of the code.</i></b>\n",
    "* Comment your code.\n",
    "  * NO code is \"self documenting\". RTFCode is for arrogant losers. WTFComments is more like it.\n",
    "  * Only YOU think the way you do.\n",
    "  * Are you doing math? Using an even slightly unusual formula? <i>Cite references in your code!</i> For scientists especially, code is just as much an expression of your work as a journal article. Treat it that way.\n",
    "* Code reuse\n",
    "  * A common trap for Python programmers is that production types want to rewrite things in Java. <i>IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOU, you will need to write a test that compares their result to yours!</i> I say this from painful experience.\n",
    "  * \"Object obsfucation\": \n",
    "    * Remember that I come from a long-ago time, when `malloc` was a thing people dealt with regularly. \n",
    "    * I abhor classes, but I've learned to live with them. \n",
    "    * Don't fall into the class trap though--too much inheritance, especially chained inheritance, makes your code unreadable, and that is a recipe for bugs. \n",
